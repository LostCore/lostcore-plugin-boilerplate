# LostCore's WordPress Plugin Boilerplate

A standardized, organized, object-oriented foundation for building high-quality WordPress Plugins.

## Contents

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate includes the following files:

* `.gitignore`. Used to exclude certain files from the repository.
* `CHANGELOG.md`. The list of changes to the core project.
* `README.md`. The file that you’re currently reading.
* A `plugin-name` directory that contains the source code.

## Features

* The Boilerplate is a more opinionated fork of the [DevinVinson's one](http://wppb.io/), and supports all the features of its parent project.
* Namespaced structure: there is no need to rename the files anymore.
* Gulp, sass, browserify support. There is a "build task" also included.
* Browserify enforce a more organized and stable structure of the javascript code.
* class-plugin, class-admin and class-public are now more deeply connected, with class-plugin in the middle. You can access them from the loader.
* Some of the redundant variables (as plugin_name, version...) are now centralized in class-plugin.
* PSR-4 Support

## Installation

The Boilerplate can be installed directly into your plugins folder "as-is". You will want to rename it and the classes inside of it to fit your needs.

Before actual activate the plugin via wordpress you need:

- To rename all occurrences of "PluginName" and "plugin-name". There is also an occurrence of "pluginName" in `assets/src/js/main.js`.
- Run `npm install`

Note tha the Boilerplate has no real functionality so no menu items, meta boxes, or custom post types will be added.

**ATTENTION**: PHP >= 5.4 is required.

## Recommended Tools

### i18n Tools

The WordPress Plugin Boilerplate uses a variable to store the text domain used when internationalizing strings throughout the Boilerplate. To take advantage of this method, there are tools that are recommended for providing correct, translatable files:

* [Poedit](http://www.poedit.net/)
* [makepot](http://i18n.svn.wordpress.org/tools/trunk/)
* [i18n](https://github.com/grappler/i18n)

Any of the above tools should provide you with the proper tooling to internationalize the plugin.
